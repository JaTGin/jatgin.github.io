              I am a Junior at Rochester Institute of Technology majoring in
              Game Design and Development. I'm and fast learner with experience
              in several programming languages, development environments, and
              design roles. I do my best work while cooperating with others- I'm
              a great team player and leader, and my adaptability and experience
              allows me to meet almost any need quickly and efficiently. When
              I'm not making games, I'm probably trying to learn something new-
              right now, I'm learning about digital audio and improving my
              cooking.

              with designing a game prototype based in the universe of a comic 
              called the Dresden Files. The result was an exploration of 
              Unity's lighting systems to create a top-down game in which 
              the player's main challenge is maneuvering through a trap-laden 
              room in a low-light environment. I was the team lead for this 
              project, and contributed to the game's art and coding, 
              designing the structure of the tutorial level we built, 
              the level editor, most of the tiles in the game's tile 
              placement system, and lighting and particle systems for the 
              game's fire effects. I also worked on auditing my team's code and debugging 
              hangups between Git and Unity."
